Personal Bot  

Upgrades:
	- be able to edit transactions so i can edit the amount i paid later instead of having to delete it all 
	- current pay period says first half but it should be second, all me to manually change this but try to automate it to be proper , if most days for pay period fall after day 15, then its second period
		- vice versa if most days fall before 15th it is first period 
	- be able to call previous pay periods spending amount so that i can properly discern how much i should pay to credit card once i get paid
		- right now it changes spending on credit to 0 when i get paid as it is a new pay period 
		- need to be able to call previous pay period to get accurate savings allocation
