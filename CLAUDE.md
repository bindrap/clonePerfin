in detailed spending by category i only have other right now
 - add TIMS
 - McDonalds
 - Dispo
 - LCBO

Category trends should reflect this, currently i dont understand what these are showing

Daily avergae by week ionstead have this be a daily average that looks at how much ive spent overall/divided by total days calculated

add any otyher analytics, charts, insights 

something a little more secrert i want is a button like a heart somewhere i can click and it will hide anything related to coitus, clicking it again will bring those elements back
